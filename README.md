# credit-risk-classification

Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report


An overview of the analysis:

Accuracy for both healthy and high-risk loans is 0.95, very accurate!, A high precision score is important to minimize false positives, which can lead to a loss of potential customers, a high recall score is important to minimize false negatives, which can lead to significant financial losses, This logistic regression model has high accuracy (0.99).

The results:
 the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
